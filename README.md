This Python application is designed for educational research purposes on studying how to automate certain workflows via image template matching using PyAutoGUI and GuiBot. PyAutoGUI accomplishes this by taking over the mouse, hence why it is recommended to run this on a separate machine than the one that you use daily. This can be circumvented by running this on a virtual machine like VMWare Workstation Player so you can keep using your main computer without interruption.

Screenshots are taken and cropped for PyAutoGUI to perform image template matching. This will determine where the bot is currently at and will inform the bot on what to do next from there. Should PyAutoGUI fail to template match, GuiBot will take over. I have found that on default settings, GuiBot performs admirably well compared to PyAutoGUI in terms of template matching.

There is a feature already in-game that can automate gameplay called "Semi/Full Auto" but does not offer any way to customize what each character does on a turn-by-turn basis. This program's primary goal is to provide that customization. Users can create their own combat scripts using predefined case-insensitive keywords and can indicate which turns the bot will execute their script, somewhat akin to constructing pseudocode.

For example:
```
// This is a comment. The bot will ignore this line.
# This is also a comment.

Turn 1:
    // On Turn 1, the following commands will be executed in order:
    // 6th Summon is invoked, character 1 uses Skill 2 and then Skill 4,
    // and finally character 3 uses Skill 3.
    summon(6)
    character1.useSkill(2).useSkill(4)
    character3.useSkill(3)
end

# The bot will keep clicking the Attack button until it reaches the 5th turn.
Turn 5:
    character2.useSkill(2)
end

// Use the exit keyword to leave the raid without retreating.
// Useful when you want to farm multiple raids at once.
exit

```

## Disclaimer
By downloading this program, you consent to your account potentially getting flagged for excessive amounts of farming for multiple hours straight and banned in the next banwave by KMR. I hold no responsibility for how much or how long you use this program for. I trust you have the self-control necessary to only farm in reasonable bursts of time with breaks in between and to always be alert for when the bot encounters the CAPTCHA.

# Instructions
1. Download the entire project folder.
2. Make sure you installed the project dependencies by having Python 3.8.3+ installed and ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a terminal.
3. Open up the game on a Chromium-based browser and log in if you haven't already done so. Click away any daily log in popups until you are at the Main/Home screen.
   1. Make sure the window size is set to this or else the bot will not be able to detect the "Home" button:
    
        ![Correct Window Size](images/readme_assets/correct_window_size.png)
4. Now open up the program in the following ways for each OS:
   - For Windows: Open up the terminal in the root of the project folder and type:
